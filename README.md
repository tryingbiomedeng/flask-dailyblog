# Flask Daily Blogging app

The idea of this app is that it is a place for people to share their daily events with people on the internet. It is similar to a public forum.

This is a simple Flask web application for managing and storing entries. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for entries, allowing you to create, view, update, and delete entries. Entries can have attributes such as date, title, content, tag, and author name.

To run the project:

1. Clone the repo
2. ```cd``` into the project on your terminal
3. Run ```pipenv shell``` to start the virtual environment
4. Run ```pipenv install -r requirements.txt```
5. Run ```pipenv run dev``` to start the application

Current bugs:
Testing is unable to run due to pytest and python compatibility issues
